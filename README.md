# jupyter-devbox-mod

## What is this?

This is a quick and dirty modification of the [jupyter-devbox devcontainer](https://github.com/jakoch/jupyter-devbox) for personal purposes.

## How do I use it?

Just put the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file in your project and run "Rebuild and Reopen in container." The Jupyter notebook web server can be launched by uncommenting the last line in the `devcontainer.json`, it is then reachable under `localhost:8888`.
